# emotion-recognition-using-csi
A research-driven machine learning project for recognizing human emotions using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) data. This work explores a non-invasive, privacy-preserving approach to emotion detection by analyzing variations in wireless signals caused by human breathing patterns and body movements.



## Dataset
